A few months ago I had the flu and was home from work. To at least try to do **something** productive with my time, I decided to create a minimal working synthesizer in C.  

The idea came about when I was thinking about how you can generate sound by generating a sound wave, and that it is incredibly easy to do this by using a maths library. In C you can just include math.h and call the sin() function.  
Since I have been interested in SDL2 for a while, I thought that it would also be a nice opportunity to check out the audio functionality of this library.  
All in all the project took me a few hours to finish, and it ended up being a bit less than 200 lines of code.  

For a bit more information on how I went about making the synthesizer, please check out the project at [this link](https://github.com/arnstein/arnSynth).  

The readme is the result of a mix between too little sleep and too much coffee, so beware!  

There are quite a few things that should have been done differently, like a variable for the font path and checking memory leaks with Valgrind. But hey, I made this to have fun, not to do it properly with testing!
