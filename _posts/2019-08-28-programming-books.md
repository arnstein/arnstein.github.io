## Hello and welcome to the first post of this blog!

I am afraid this blog will end up being ramblings of a maniac, but it is more likely that it just ends up being deserted after some time.

Often when I speak to people who are new to programming, or that want to get into programming, I find myself saying that there’s some really good books that they just *have* to read. When they ask which books, I say that I have a list that I will give them. Unfortunately this list only exists in my head, and I always forget to follow up on this request.  
What better way to start my blog then, than by making this list, so I can forever link to it instead of just making an empty promise?


**Code Complete** 2nd Edition by Steve McConnell:  
This must be the best thing ever released by Microsoft! This book covers a wide range of topic, from sensible variable names to refactoring code. If you are going to read only one of the books I’m listing, it should be this one!

**Head First Design Patterns** by Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Freeman, Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates:  
Although Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is considered the most classic book on design patterns, I found that book to be a bit hard to read. So if you are as dumb as I am, then I can highly recommend Head First design patterns!

**Introduction to Algorithms** by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein:  
This book is heavy. Not only physically(2.25kg according to Amazon), but also its content. But the hard work of studying this book pays off! Come to think about it, I should probably refresh my memory of its contents myself...

**Pragmatic Programmer** by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas:  
This book is a fun read, and gives you plenty of helpful tips to becoming a better programmer. Rumour has it that a new edition is being released in 2019 as it is the 20th anniversary of the book.

**Clean Code** and **Clean Coder** by Robert C. Martin:  
Two books by the same author, which in my opinion compliments each other very well. Clean Code is a more technical book about writing good, self-explanatory code, while Clean Coder is more about the day-to-day life of a professional programmer.

**Mythical Man Month** by Fred Brooks:  
Even though this book might be more relevant for managers, there is definitely lots of wisdom in this book that programmers can learn from, and even using it as an argument if you see your manager doing one of the common mistakes mentioned in this book.

**Programming Pearls** by Jon Bentley:  
This book teaches you everything from defining the problem correctly to solutions to how to speed up insertion sort. Some people criticize it today saying that it is outdated and today we have already optimized libraries that does “everything”, but I still think this book teaches you how to think like a programmer.


And here are a few books I want to read:
Refactoring by Martin Fowler  
Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools  


**Three more tips for a new programmer**:

* Learn to be proficient in at least one language
    * Which language depends on what you want to do. The best language for programming microcontrollers isn’t the best language for creating reactive front-ends.
* Do programming challenges
    * There are several websites where you can find programming challenges. This can be everything from sorting arrays in a certain way to making small applications. Project Euler, CodeEval and LeetCode are examples of websites with challenges.
* Create something
    * Find something that motivates you, and create it! This can be anything. A website? A game? A robot arm that flip the bird? Start programming!
